Functionalities of the project:

A 3x3 grid displayed on the console using characters.
Two modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer (AI).
Player inputs moves using row and column numbers.
Detects winning condition (three in a row) or draw.
AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., already occupied cell).
Option to restart the game after it ends.

Key benefits for learner: 

Deepens understanding of 2D arrays and board representation.
Provides hands-on experience with the Minimax algorithm for decision-making.
Enhances problem-solving and game logic implementation skills.
Teaches modular programming through separate functions for board printing, checking winners, and AI logic.
Strengthens debugging and testing abilities by simulating game scenarios.
Lays a foundation for more complex AI-driven games and strategies
